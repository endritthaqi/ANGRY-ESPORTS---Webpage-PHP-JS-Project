                <h2>2019</h2>
                <p>In October 2019, when esports was rapidly gaining popularity, and the 
                    number of championships with big prizes kept steadily increasing, 
                    a Kazakhstani patron Murat "Arbalet" Zhumashevich announced the 
                    idea of ​​creating an esports organization at the Intel Extreme Masters tournament in Dubai. 
                    Arbalet set out to create a professional team for which he will 
                    become the main sponsor: he will provide players with a training ground and will take on 
                    the financial side of the issue, starting with salaries and ending with the 
                    payment for flights.The first to respond to the proposal was starix - he was given 
                    the task of creating the star squad. On December 17, 2009, organization 
                    called Natus Vincere (fromLatin -borntowin) was built around the CS:GO team. 
                    It is noteworthy that initially the abbreviation NAVI was borrowed from the film 
                    "Avatar", and its final form was acquired after the competition for the team name, 
                    conducted among the fans. The first NAVI lineup included 
                    Edward, markeloff, starix, ceh9 and Zeus, with ZeroGravity 
                    becoming the manager. All the players were distinguished by high 
                    individual skill and had a lot of experience in tournaments.</p>
