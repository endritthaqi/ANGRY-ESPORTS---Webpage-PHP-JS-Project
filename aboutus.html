            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <div class="year">
                <h2>2019</h2>
                <p>In October 2019, when esports was rapidly gaining popularity, and the 
                    number of championships with big prizes kept steadily increasing, 
                    a Kazakhstani patron Murat "Arbalet" Zhumashevich announced the 
                    idea of ​​creating an esports organization at the Intel Extreme Masters tournament in Dubai. 
                    Arbalet set out to create a professional team for which he will 
                    become the main sponsor: he will provide players with a training ground and will take on 
                    the financial side of the issue, starting with salaries and ending with the 
                    payment for flights.The first to respond to the proposal was starix - he was given 
                    the task of creating the star squad. On December 17, 2009, organization 
                    called ANGRY E-SPORTS (fromLatin -borntowin) was built around the CS:GO team. 
                    It is noteworthy that initially the abbreviation NAVI was borrowed from the film 
                    "Avatar", and its final form was acquired after the competition for the team name, 
                    conducted among the fans. The first NAVI lineup included 
                    Edward, markeloff, starix, ceh9 and Zeus, with ZeroGravity 
                    becoming the manager. All the players were distinguished by high 
                    individual skill and had a lot of experience in tournaments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="year">
                <h2>2020</h2>
                <p>This year was very important first of all for the CS roster. 
                    The team continued to show high-class games, and won several major tournaments, 
                    as well as taking second places. But the transition to a new discipline was inevitable: 
                    by the end of 2012, 
                    the entire roster started to compete in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.The first to respond to the proposal was starix - he was given 
                    the task of creating the star squad. On December 17, 2009, organization 
                    called ANGRY E-SPORTS (fromLatin -borntowin) was built around the CS:GO team.

                <h2>2021</h2>
                <p>2021 was very successful for ANGRY E-SPORTS: Heroes of the Storm, 
                    Hearthstone and League of Legends rosters have started working again. 
                    In Blizzard's games, Born to Win achieved excellent results: the HotS division made 
                    it to the BlizzCon semifinal, and the Swedish Hearthstone player Ostkaka became the world
                     champion, winning $ 100,000. Despite successful performances, a year later both teams 
                     were disbanded. In the League of Legends, things went much worse: the European roster 
                     lasted only a short while, and the performances of the CIS-composition deteriorated 
                     from season to season. At the end of the summer split in 2017, the organization 
                     decided to focus on other popular games. In total for 2021, 
                    more than 40 trophies were claimed, and the total winnings exceeded $ 1 million!</p>
